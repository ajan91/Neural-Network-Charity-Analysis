Deliverable 1 Requirements

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

    The following preprocessing steps have been performed:
        The EIN and NAME columns have been dropped (5 pt)
        The columns with more than 10 unique values have been grouped together (5 pt)
        The categorical variables have been encoded using one-hot encoding (5 pt)
        The preprocessed data is split into features and target arrays (5 pt)
        The preprocessed data is split into training and testing datasets (5 pt)
        The numerical values have been standardized using the StandardScaler() module (5 pt)


Deliverable 2 Requirements

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:

    The neural network model using Tensorflow Keras contains working code that performs the following steps:
        The number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and activation function are defined (2.5 pt)
        An output layer with an activation function is created (2.5 pt)
        There is an output for the structure of the model (5 pt)
        There is an output of the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy (5 pt)
        The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs (2.5 pt)
        The results are saved to an HDF5 file (2.5 pt)



Deliverable 3 Requirements

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 3 by completing all requirements below:

    The model is optimized, and the predictive accuracy is increased to over 75%, or there is working code that makes three attempts to increase model performance using the following steps:
        Noisy variables are removed from features (2.5 pt)
        Additional neurons are added to hidden layers (2.5 pt)
        Additional hidden layers are added (5 pt)
        The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization (5 pt)
        The model's weights are saved every 5 epochs (2.5 pt)
        The results are saved to an HDF5 file (2.5 pt)
